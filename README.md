### Project Overview

In the spirit of the original Primer, YLIP leverages the power of 
Large Language Models (LLMs) to craft enchanting fairy tale-based

Our digital primer aims to inspire and educate, weaving tales that 
captivate both young and old. Join us on this journey as we blend 
the magic of storytelling with cutting-edge AI technology,
